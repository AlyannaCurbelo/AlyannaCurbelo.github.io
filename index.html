    <h1>Claim</h1> 
    <p>I believe that the mystery black box has a box/a storing system where the water stays. I am positive that it's in there.</p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>The mystery black box is a type of liquid machine where you can pour liquid in, and liquid is transmitted out.  My initial thoughts and observations were that when water was going in, it was stored somewhere inside the box. An example as to why I thought this is because when we poured in 500ml, only 110 would come out. Which would mean, it had to be going somewhere because the amounts of water were not consistent. In our model, we had  a storing system. We would pour in an amount of water, with either more or less coming out regardless if we kept the input the same. The key function of our model was the storing of the water, which is how we were able to mimic that function.  An example would be when we poured in 250ml, only 150ml would come out. This is because most of the 250 was stored in a cup. We tested our model by primarily focusing on how we store the water.</p>
    
    <h1>Reasoning</h1>
    <h2>P1</h2>
    <p>A model is a visual representation of an idea or thing, so others can have a better understanding on a subject. It's very helpful for visual learners, or for trying to understand things with more depth.</p>
    <h2>P2</h2>
    <p>The reason why you should believe my claim is because of the amount of overwhelming data. Example, if there was a storing system, you would put in more water, and less would come out. In our data within multiple trials, when we would put a large amount of water, only a little bit would transmit. Example, inputting 150 and 50 coming out. And this is identical to the way the original black box functions, as multiple black box trials show the same type of outcome. There's a little amount each time. 250 in, 160 out. Even if results showed more coming out, that would furthermore prove my claim due to the storing system overflowing. Just like our model of the box did.</p>
    <h2>P3</h2>
    <p>If there was not a storing system in the box, then the amount of water that would be inputed would be consistent with the water that comes out. If you put in 500ml, youâ€™d get 500ml. Not less or more. Which was not experienced when we made our own model. If not, the complete opposite.</p>
