    <h1>Claim</h1> 

    <p>I believe that the mystery black box has a box/a storing system where the water stays. I am positive that it's in there.</p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>The mystery black box is a type of liquid machine where you can pour liquid in, and liquid is transmitted out.  My initial thoughts and observations were that when water was going in, it was stored somewhere inside the box. An example as to why I thought this is because when we poured in 500ml, only 110 would come out. Which would mean, it had to be going somewhere because the amounts of water were not consistent. In our model, we had  a storing system. We would pour in an amount of water, with either more or less coming out regardless if we kept the input the same. The key function of our model was the storing of the water, which is how we were able to mimic that function.  An example would be when we poured in 250ml, only 150ml would come out. This is because most of the 250 was stored in a cup. We tested our model by primarily focusing on how we store the water.</p>
